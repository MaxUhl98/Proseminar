My colleague D. v. Weyck and I explored the capabilities of the AutoML frameworks OpenFE and AutoGluon for our mathematical studies project. We tested these approaches on a completed Kaggle Playground Competition, measuring our performance against the actual leaderboard values. Despite the competition being finished when our seminar started, we achieved top 20% results using fewer than 30 lines of code.
By incorporating additional feature engineering techniques—which were ultimately excluded from the seminar due to time and workload constraints—we further improved our performance, achieving a top 10% result. We are currently preparing a seminar paper detailing our findings and methodology, which will be posted upon completion.
