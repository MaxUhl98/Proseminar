Seminar work together with my colleague D. v. Weyck, we demonstrated that by just using a combination of the AutoML frameworks OpenFE and Autogluon you can become a top 20% participant at a kaggle playground competition with very little effort. We also were able to reach top 10% by the addition of feature engineering, which we cut from the seminar work due to time/work constraints. The seminar paper is currently WiP and will be posted once it is finished.
