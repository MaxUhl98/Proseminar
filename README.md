My colleague D. v. Weyck and I examined the capabilities of the AutoML frankeworks OpenFE and Autogluon for our mathematical studies project. We tested those approaches on a finished [Kaggle Playground Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e4) and were able to reach top 20% results with less than 30 lines of code. Please note, that the competition we mention was already finished when our seminar started, so we measured our ranks in compared the the values of the actual competitors and we are therefore not actually present on the leaderboard. By incorporating additional feature engineering techniques (which were ultimately excluded from the seminar due to time and workload constraints), we further improved our performance, achieving a top 10% result. The seminar paper detailing our findings and methodology is currently being worked on and will be posted upon completion.
