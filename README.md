In collaboration with my colleague D. v. Weyck, we explored the potential of AutoML frameworks, specifically OpenFE and Autogluon, in achieving high rankings in Kaggle playground competitions. Our initial approach, which involved only these frameworks, placed us in the top 20% of participants with minimal effort. Note that the competition we mention was already finished when our seminar started, so we measured our ranks in compared the the values of the actual competitors and we are therefore not actually present on the leaderboard. By incorporating additional feature engineering techniques (which were ultimately excluded from the seminar due to time and workload constraints), we further improved our performance, achieving a top 10% ranking. The seminar paper detailing our findings and methodology is currently a work in progress and will be posted upon completion.
